This suggests the true severity of sleep apnea is underestimated on this study (as reflected by the AHI).\n\nTreatment options for this level of obstructive sleep apnea include CPAP therapy, best treatment option, or a custom fabricated mandibular advancement device (MAD). In addition, behavioral modifications such as weight loss (if applicable), abstaining from alcohol/sedating medications/tobacco (if applicable) near bedtime, and avoidance of sleep in supine position are suggested.\n\nIf CPAP is chosen, it can be initiated either through a dedicated CPAP titration study (preferred) or through an auto-titrating CPAP machine (APAP) initially set to 5-12 cm of water. Close clinical follow-up is recommended with use of CPAP data downloads to confirm both compliance and efficacy of treatment.\nIf a MAD (worn nightly in conjunction with a positional therapy device) is chosen, a follow-up sleep study should be undertaken while using this device to confirm efficacy.\n\nObstructive Sleep Apnea G4733",
