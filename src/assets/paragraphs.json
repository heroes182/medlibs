    "NoOsa": "The apnea-hypopnea index was [AHI] and the Spo2 nadir [NADIR] % with average Spo2 [AVG] % (confirmed by plethysmography) which does not meet the diagnostic criteria for obstructive sleep apnea. Home sleep apnea tests (HSAT) have false negative rates as high as 24% and may underestimate AHI by a value upwards of 25 events/hr.  Age over 50 was the primary predictor of a positive polysomnogram after a negative HSAT.  (Zeidler MR, Santiago V, Dzierzewski JM, Mitchell MN, Santiago S, Martin JL. Predictors of obstructive sleep apnea on polysomnography after a technically inadequate or normal home sleep test. J Clin Sleep Med 2015;11(11):1313â€“18.)  Therefore, if clinical suspicion for sleep disordered breathing remains high, a dedicated in-lab polysomnogram is recommended.* [*In patients with a moderate to high pretest probability for obstructive sleep apnea, home sleep testing has adequate specificity to rule-in OSA but it lacks the sensitivity to definitively rule-out OSA. In such cases, a negative home sleep test should be followed by in-lab polysomnography which has adequate sensitivity to definitively rule-out OSA.

    "OsaMild": "These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with an AHI of [AHI]  and SpO2 nadir of [NADIR] % with average Spo2 [AVG] % (confirmed by plethysmography).   Obstructive sleep apnea was [SEVERITY] while in the supine position   In addition, flow limitation and oxygen desaturations of 3% or less (not meeting the IB scoring criteria used on this study) were noted to occur.  This suggests the true severity of sleep apnea is underestimated on this study (as reflected by the AHI).     Treatment options for this level of obstructive sleep apnea include CPAP therapy, best treatment option, or a custom fabricated mandibular advancement device (MAD). In addition, behavioral modifications such as weight loss (if applicable), abstaining from alcohol/sedating medications/tobacco (if applicable) near bedtime, and avoidance of sleep in supine position are suggested. If CPAP is chosen, it can be initiated either through a dedicated CPAP titration study (preferred) or through an auto-titrating CPAP machine (APAP) initially set to 5-12 cm of water. Close clinical follow-up is recommended with use of CPAP data downloads to confirm both compliance and efficacy of treatment.  If a MAD (worn nightly in conjunction with a positional therapy device) is chosen, a follow-up sleep study should be undertaken while using this device to confirm efficacy.
